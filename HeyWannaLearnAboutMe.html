		<p>#ME!:p<br>
		Hi I'm Harmony LeSueur! I currently go by Jade Wolf to all my Friends. But you can call me whatever you want to.<br>
		I currently have learned how to ride horses , Draw anime , Make a lot of cool art , and how to ride western on horse back!<br>
		I'm 12 but turning 13 in November! I really love the school I'm at! I have lots of friends there... But I have lots of other friends in my neighbor hood.<br>
		I miss my old friends from my other school. I am learing how to draw Manga right now , but I'm epically failing! Oh well thats a little about me.<br></p>
